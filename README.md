# Sentiment-Detection
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep neural network capable of analyzing both text and image data to detect sentiment. By leveraging the strengths of multimodal data, this model aims to provide more accurate and nuanced sentiment analysis than traditional text-only approaches. The project involves data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

Dataset used: MSCTD: [A Multimodal Sentiment Chat Translation Dataset](https://github.com/XL2248/MSCTD?tab=readme-ov-file)
